# GameBots
Not one those resourceful repositories you find on  github. All you find is some bots written to play some small games. That's it
- The BlackSmithBot is written by following a part of this tutorial series https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks4MPfMq8aQ&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDeETZEOy4VdocT7TOjfSA8a by sentdex on youtube. The directkeys file is downloaded and reuploaded from the repository created for the tutorial series (Is it illegal?)
